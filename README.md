# car-parking-system

## Prerequisites

1. Java 11 - Follow [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-get-on-ubuntu-16-04) for installation instructions
2. Maven - Follow [here](https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/how-to-install-maven-on-ubuntu-16-04/) for installtion instructions
3. Redis

### 3 ways to run Redis

Redis is used by the application for temporary storage.

#### Embedded Redis

The application comes with an embedded Redis, and it as advised to use this instead for this package version. 

To enable embedded Redis, the property below in the `application.yml` file must be set to true:
```yaml
app:
  redis:
    embedded: true
```
Every application restart, the Redis instance will be considered as fresh, so no data from previous runs will linger.

#### Redis by Docker

Redis can also be installed without the trouble of manual setup by using Docker.

To install Docker, follow [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04)

After Docker has been successfully installed (make sure user has necessary permission to execute/run docker commands), execute the command below to get and deploy Redis image.
```shell
$ cd <project_dir>
$ docker-compose up
```

#### Manual installtion of Redis

Please follow [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-redis-on-ubuntu-16-04)

## Car Parking System Application

### Requirement

Your task is to design an automated valet car parking system where you manage a parking space
for vehicles as they enter/exit it and manage its revenue. The data provided to you(refer to the
Data Description section below) would include the number of parking lots available and the
entry/exit details of each vehicle. For the purpose of this question you can assume that Cars and
Motorcycles are the only two types of vehicles.

Each vehicle upon entry can only park in a lot available for that vehicle type. If there are no lots
available for that vehicle type, it should be denied an entry into the space. As weâ€™re building a
valet car park, all the lots in the parking space can be considered as being distinctly numbered
eg: CarLot1, CarLot2,..., MotorcycleLot1, MotorcycleLot2,.... Each vehicle upon entering is allotted
to the lot with the lowest number for that vehicular type eg: a car entering a parking space with
the available lots CarLot2, CarLot4, CarLot5 would be assigned to CarLot2. When a vehicle wants
to exit the car park, the system will return the parking lot that the vehicle will be removed from
and charge them an appropriate parking fee(rounded up to the nearest hour, i.e., 1hr 1min is
charged as 2hr): $1/hour for a motorcycle and $2/hour for a car.

You may use any language/framework for this exercise.

#### Data Description

Your program accepts an input file as an argument when running. The format of the file is
described below:

```text
3 4
Enter motorcycle SGX1234A 1613541902 
Enter car SGF9283P 1613541902
Exit SGX1234A 1613545602
Enter car SGP2937F 1613546029
Enter car SDW2111W 1613549730
Enter car SSD9281L 1613549740
Exit SDW2111W 1613559745
```

The first line indicates the number of parking slots that are present in the space for Cars and
Motorcycles respectively in the parking lot.

For each subsequent line, there would be two types of events:
- Vehicle entering the space: Enter <motorcycle|car> <vehicle number>
<timestamp>. The program should print out either Accept or Reject based on the
availability of lots in the parking space. If the vehicle is accepted, the program also returns
the name of the lot being occupied by it. 
- Vehicle exiting the space: Exit <vehicle number> <timestamp>. The program
prints out the released lot and the parking fee.

Given the example above, the program output would look like:

```text
Accept MotorcycleLot1
Accept CarLot1
MotorcycleLot1 2
Accept CarLot2
Accept CarLot3
Reject
CarLot3 6
```

Any erroneous cases should be handled with an appropriate error message.

### Assumptions

1. Only 2 types of vehicle are supported. Car and Motorcycle, and other vehicles would not get processed.
2. Only 2 types of events are supported. Enter and Exit, and other type of events would not get processed.
3. File can be placed in any folder within the system (as long as it can be accessed by the app)
4. Multiple files can be used, and all files must be processed.
5. If multiple files are there, each file will be considered as a new setup.
6. The data and results don't need to get persisted
7. Result must be in the same order as the input was processed.
8. If the first line of the file is more than 2, or not in numeric format. The whole file will be skipped and not get processed. This part must be accurate, as it will be the main factor to identify the number of lots available.

### Edge Cases

1. If the first line of the file is more than 2, or not in numeric format. The whole file will be skipped and not get processed.
2. If the event is neither Enter nor Exit. The data will be skipped, and proceed to process the next line.
3. If the vehicle is neither Car nor Motorcycle. The data will be skipped, and proceed to process the next line.
4. Duplicate processing of plate number for the same event is not allowed. E.g. If plate number had entered previously and not yet exited, the plate number would not get processed for another Enter event until he exits the current one.
5. Exit event without an Enter event would not get processed. Data would be skipped.
